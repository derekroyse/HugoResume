case_summary: "This is a very simple, one page web application used to merge images, PDFs, and Office files into a single PDF. More of an exercise in quickly setting up and hosting Django website than a code heavy project, this site functions as more of a test bed for things like SEO and pen testing."

testimonial: "Alexis designed everything for Cope from the ground up. What I really like about him is his true understanding and grasp of what makes a great UI great. He knows that the user experience needs a lot of refining from customers and he isn't shy to take feedback even if it's critical. Alexis is one of those rare people who just gets it."
