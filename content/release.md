testimonial: "Alexis designed everything for Cope from the ground up. What I really like about him is his true understanding and grasp of what makes a great UI great. He knows that the user experience needs a lot of refining from customers and he isn't shy to take feedback even if it's critical. Alexis is one of those rare people who just gets it."
