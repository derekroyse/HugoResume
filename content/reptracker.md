case_description: "I created a web application to provide everyone with the ability to easily access the truth about their federal, state, and local representatives."
case_feature_img: "reptrackerbig.png"
case_summary: "This site was originally created as a .Net project, using a number of free APIs to determine a user's federal and state representatives based on their address. Over time, the site expanded to include voting data, statistics, and local representatives."
case_summary2: "After some time, some of the APIs used for Representative Tracker's core functions were updated to no longer provide the necessary information and in some cases shut down entirely. Because of this, the site was disabled for awhile. When I began learning Django, this represented an opportunity to rebuild the site with new APIs and improved functionality. The site was rebuilt using Django in 2019 and moved from AppHarbor to Heroku."
case_summary3: "A similar situation arose when I became interested in learning React. I was never 100% happy with the look of Representative Tracker, and I decided to rebuild the app again as a REST API with a React frontend. This, along with a move to a more easily managed Digital Ocean droplet, was completed in 2021."

testimonial: "Alexis designed everything for Cope from the ground up. What I really like about him is his true understanding and grasp of what makes a great UI great. He knows that the user experience needs a lot of refining from customers and he isn't shy to take feedback even if it's critical. Alexis is one of those rare people who just gets it."
