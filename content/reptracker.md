case_summary: "This site was originally created as a .Net project, using a number of free APIs to determine a user's federal and state representatives based on their address. Over time, the site expanded to include voting data, statistics, and local representatives."
case_summary2: "After some time, some of the APIs used for Representative Tracker's core functions were updated to no longer provide the necessary information and in some cases shut down entirely. Because of this, the site was disabled for awhile. When I began learning Django, this represented an opportunity to rebuild the site with new APIs and improved functionality. The site was rebuilt using Django in 2019 and moved from AppHarbor to Heroku."
case_summary3: "A similar situation arose when I became interested in learning React. I was never 100% happy with the look of Representative Tracker, and I decided to rebuild the app again as a REST API with a React frontend. This, along with a move to a more easily managed Digital Ocean droplet, was completed in 2021."

testimonial: "Alexis designed everything for Cope from the ground up. What I really like about him is his true understanding and grasp of what makes a great UI great. He knows that the user experience needs a lot of refining from customers and he isn't shy to take feedback even if it's critical. Alexis is one of those rare people who just gets it."

# Origins

![](//localhost:1313/cope/img/persona.png)

A startup called Cope hired me to create a **minimum viable product**
for their new idea â€” tracking mental health. It was the first project
where I handled mobile app design, and I was very excited to learn the
intricacies of the iOS platform.

My clients John and Kat have done some preliminary interviews
with psychologists and psychiatrists to get their side of the picture.
They have established a user persona, a business model canvas, and
several startup prep work for the product to take off. My job was to
actually create the experience for their users and make sure they are
represented in the design process.

The design I created was a result of self-started questions,
validating assumptions, benchmarking,  and guerilla testing. I could
have done some more usability studies early in the process, however.

# Rebuild

We checked the App Store for similar applications, and we found
out that there were no well-designed niche applications for handling
mental health. We found another app called Cope as well, but their
solution was more of a community-based social sharing platform. We saw
this as an opportunity for our own version of Cope to solve a unique
problem in the space.

Instead, we drew inspiration from applications that feature the
design components we needed: menstrual cycle management apps that have
good summaries and calendars, emotion tracking apps, medicine tracking apps.

I used the concepts gained from these applications to study how
they understood the mental models of their own users and hopefully
replicate that kind of empathy whenever I create design decisions for Cope.

# React

We had feature changes and a lot of design decisions cancelled.
Before, we had different modules for the design: forums, mental health
doctor search, messaging.

![](//localhost:1313/cope/img/discarded.jpg)

We finalized the components of Cope that we wanted to build and
we decided that we wanted to focus on tracking their progress for
mental health. I had to drop some UI explorations I did for the first
version of Cope we were building.
            
# Next Steps

The project is actually in development now and the next step is
to conduct usability tests, install analytics and use new insights to
inform new iterations of the product. Design a better onboarding
process. Design for empty states. Design copywriting and strategy for
push notifications as trigger. Integrate a social aspect into the
application. All these will be helpful to create a better design for the app.

In reality, product design is the easy part. The real problems
we're facing involve fighting a stigma around mental health, building an
open, supportive and vulnerable community, and creating a sustainable
business model for the product. -->
