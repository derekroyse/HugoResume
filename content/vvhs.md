case_summary: "The Virginia Volunteer Health System (VVHS) is a web-based information, alerting and credentialing system used by local Medical Reserve Corps Coordinators and health districts for the management of medical and support volunteers who desire to support public health emergencies and daily public health activities in Virginia. There are currently more than 30,000 volunteers registered in VVHS and coordinators can use this system to find, alert, and track volunteers using a variety of filters, groups, and roles."
case_summary2: "Health professionals and non-medical volunteers are encouraged to join. Volunteers will receive various training offerings in all-hazards training as well as specific health events. VVHS is used by Virginia Medical Reserve Corps units and local health districts. The Virginia Department of Health and local health districts work closely with other emergency response groups, such as the Red Cross, Salvation Army, Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT), Citizen Corps partners and others to coordinate volunteers in an emergency. This coordination allows these groups to work together with VDH to address our communities' needs."
case_summary3: "Throughout my time at SiteVision I have been responsible for maintaining the VVHS application, ensuring that alerts are delivered as quickly and efficiently as possible, as well as maintaining the application's cybersecurity posture to protect PII and data integrity. I have also completed a large number of upgrades and new features for the application, some of which include an overhaul to the volunteer dashboard, a responsive redesign of the entire application, and numerous updates to assist volunteer coordinators in importing and exporting large amount of data about volunteers and their deployments and training."
case_summary4: "Many updates to the core application functionality were made in order to suppor the large influx of volunteers during the state's COVID response beginning in 2020. As SiteVision's lead developer, I worked with statewide volunteer coordinators to understand their needs and rapidly deploy updates that allowed them to process volunteers more quickly and to collect volunteer vaccination and immunization training data. These features provided Virginia with the tools necessary to support the largest state Medical Reserve Corps deployment during the COVID crisis."
